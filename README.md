## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryavtiwari2005/edu-ccrm.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd edu-ccrm
   ```

3. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the compiled classes with the Java runtime:

```bash
java MainClassName
```

⚠️ Replace `MainClassName` with the actual entry point class once defined.

---

## Project Structure

Key files in the project include:

- **Student.java** – Represents student entities.
- **Instructor.java** – Represents instructors.
- **Course.java** – Represents course entities.
- **Enrollment.java** – Handles student enrollments.
- **Grade.java** – Represents student grades.
- **Semester.java** – Represents academic semesters.
- **Services**:

  - `StudentService.java`
  - `CourseService.java`
  - `EnrollmentService.java`
  - `BackupService.java`
  - `ImportExportService.java`

- **Utilities**:

  - `RecursiveUtils.java`

- **Base Class**:

  - `Person.java`

---

## Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- No external libraries required (pure Java)

---

## Examples

Example: Creating a new course and enrolling a student.

```java
Student student = new Student("John Doe", "12345");
Instructor instructor = new Instructor("Dr. Smith");
Course course = new Course("Data Structures", instructor);
Enrollment enrollment = new Enrollment(student, course);
enrollment.assignGrade(new Grade("A"));
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Compilation errors**: Ensure JDK 8+ is installed and environment variables are set.
- **Missing entry point**: Verify the main class file has a `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
- **File handling errors**: Check permissions when using `BackupService` or `ImportExportService`.

Would you like me to also **add a sample `Main.java` entry point** (so users can directly run and test the system), or just keep the README general?
